Activity 5

## Data and packages

Again, we will load all of the `{tidyverse}` for this Activity.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

We continue our exploration of college majors and earnings from the data
behind the FiveThirtyEight story [The Economic Guide To Picking A
College
Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).
Remember that there are many considerations that go into picking a
major. Earning potential and employment prospects are two (important) of
these considerations, but they do not tell the entire story.

We read in the same data from Activity 4 below, but notice that this
code is now surrounded in parentheses.

``` r
(college_recent_grads <- read_csv("data/recent-grads.csv"))
```

Compare this code output to the `load_data` chunk in your knitted
Activity 4 `.md` report. What does enclosing an assignment code (i.e.,
`object_name <- r_code`) in parentheses do?

**Response**: When I rerun the code from Activity 4, I notice that I do
not get the table to page through. It notifies you of the

The questions we will answer in this activity are:

-   How do the distributions of median income compare across major
    categories?
-   Do women tend to choose majors with lower or higher earnings?

## Analysis

### Median Earnings Description

### Median … Median Earnings

For the rest of this semester, I will no longer provide you with R code
chunks. Have no fear! There are a number of ways to create a code chunk:

-   Tired: Copy-and-paste a previous code chunk, delete the code, then
    add your new code
-   Wired: Click on the ![new chunk icon](README-img/new-chunk-icon.png)
    and select ![r chunk icon](README-img/r-chunk-icon.png) (notice all
    the different types of code chunks that you can use within an
    RMarkdown file!)
-   Inspired: Ctrl/Command + Alt/Option + I

Below, create a code chunk and name it `median_earnings`. Make sure
there is an empty line above and below the code chunk.

In your newly created R code chunk, verify that the median income for
all majors was $36,000. Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and
functions from `{dplyr}`, verify the *median* summary statistic for the
variable median earnings of full-time, year-round workers (`median`).
Name this numerical summary `median_all_majors`.

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any
questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Additional Summaries of Median Earnings

Often we would like more information than the median to help us to
better understand the distribution of a variable. Using the
`college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain the
sample size (i.e., *n*umber of observations), *mean*, *s*tandard
*d*eviation, *min*imum, *median*, and *max*imum summaries for the
variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers. Be careful
when you name your output summaries as we are dealing with things that
could use the same name (i.e., “median”). When I and obtaining numerical
summaries for variables, I like to include the variable name in my
summary name (e.g., `mean_med_earnings = mean(median)`). Create a code
chunk and name it `summary_earnings`.

Provide a discussion on what you believe the distribution of median
earnings will look like. You should discuss the center, spread, and
potential shape only using these values - I do NOT want to see any data
visualizations here.

**Response**:

### Median Earnings by Major Category

Now we will see how the different major categories compare to the
overall distribution of median earnings. Using the
`college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain
similar summaries of the variable `median` earnings of full-time,
year-round workers as your `summary_earnings` code chunk, *by* for each
`major_category`. *Arrange* this summary table by the median earning.
Create a code chunk and name it `major_earnings`.

Provide a discussion on how each major compares to the overall
distribution. You should discuss the center, spread, and potential shape
only using these summary values - I do NOT want to see any data
visualizations here.

**Response**:

Before we continue, add the following to the end of your pipeline (you
will need to pipe first) in your `major_earnings` code chunk:

    knitr::kable()

Knit your document with and without this last piped code. What changes
about the output? When would this `knitr::kable` code be useful?

**Response**:

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any
questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Visualize Median Earnings by Major Category

Let us see how well your descriptions in the [Median Earnings by Major
Category](#median-earnings-by-major-category) section compare to the
actual distributions. Plot the distribution of the variable `median`
earnings of full-time, year-round workers for each `major_category`
using the *boxplot* and *jitter* geometries. Create a code chunk and
name it `major_boxplot`.

Provide a discussion on how your descriptions in the Median Earnings by
Major Category section compares.

**Response**:

<img src="README-img/noun_pause.png" alt="pause" width = "20"/>
<b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you feel that you have a good
understanding of these commands, feel free to start working on your
project. The remainder of this activity will help to expand these
commands.

### Multiple Rankings

#### Ranking by `major_category`

The current rankings provided in the data are by `major`. Here we will
develop a series of rankings to see how the `major_category` levels
perform. Create a code chunk and name it `category_rankings`. In this
code chunk,

1.  Group `college_recent_grads` by `major_category`
2.  Summarize the variable `total` as the *sum* across all majors (to
    get the total number of majors within a `major_category`) and the
    following variables by their *median* value: `sharewomen`,
    `unemployment_rate`, and `median` earnings. Provide a meaningful
    name to each summarized value.
3.  Assign/create a *rank* for each summarized value (rank for `total`,
    rank for `sharewomen`, etc.) and provide a meaningful name to each
    ranked column value.
4.  Arrange the results so that `major_category` appear in alphabetical
    order (“A” at the top).

Provide a discussion on how the `major_category` rankings compare.

**Response**:

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **(Final) Planned Pause Point**: If you
have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to
continue on.

Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a
meaningful commit message), and push to your GitHub repo. Go to GitHub
and verify that your `activity04-data-pieplines.Rmd` file appears as you
intended it to.

You can now go back to the `README` file.
