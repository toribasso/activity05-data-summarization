## Data and packages

Again, we will load all of the `{tidyverse}` for this Activity.

```{r load_packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We continue our exploration of college majors and earnings from the data behind the FiveThirtyEight story [The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).
Remember that there are many considerations that go into picking a major.
Earning potential and employment prospects are two (important) of these considerations, but they do not tell the entire story.

We read in the same data from Activity 4 below, but notice that this code is now surrounded in parentheses.

```{r load_data, message=FALSE}
(college_recent_grads <- read_csv("data/recent-grads.csv"))
```

Compare this code output to the `load_data` chunk in your knitted Activity 4 `.md` report.
What does enclosing an assignment code (i.e., `object_name <- r_code`) in parentheses do?

**Response**: When I rerun the code from Activity 4, I notice that I do not get 
the table to page through. It notifies you of the first ten observations in the 
datasheet. While the non-parentheses version does not.


### Data Codebook

Descriptions of the variables are again provided below.
Again note that the ACS only asks [one question](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/sex/) about a person's sexual identity.

- Do women tend to choose majors with lower or higher earnings?

## Analysis

### Median Earnings Description

### Median ... Median Earnings 

For the rest of this semester, I will no longer provide you with R code chunks.
Have no fear!
There are a number of ways to create a code chunk:

- Tired: Copy-and-paste a previous code chunk, delete the code, then add your new code
- Wired: Click on the ![new chunk icon](README-img/new-chunk-icon.png) and select ![r chunk icon](README-img/r-chunk-icon.png) (notice all the different types of code chunks that you can use within an RMarkdown file!)
- Inspired: Ctrl/Command + Alt/Option + I

Below, create a code chunk and name it `median_earnings`.
Make sure there is an empty line above and below the code chunk.

```{r median_earnings, message=FALSE}
college_recent_grads %>%
  summary(median(median))
```


In your newly created R code chunk, verify that the median income for all majors was $36,000.
Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, verify the *median* summary statistic for the variable median earnings of full-time, year-round workers (`median`).
Name this numerical summary `median_all_majors`.

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Additional Summaries of Median Earnings

Often we would like more information than the median to help us to better understand the distribution of a variable.
Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain the sample size (i.e., *n*umber of observations), *mean*, *s*tandard *d*eviation, *min*imum, *median*, and *max*imum summaries for the variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers.
Be careful when you name your output summaries as we are dealing with things that could use the same name (i.e., "median").
When I and obtaining numerical summaries for variables, I like to include the variable name in my summary name (e.g., `mean_med_earnings = mean(median)`).
Create a code chunk and name it `summary_earnings`.

```{r summary_earnings}
summarise(college_recent_grads, 
          mean_med_earnings=mean(median),
          stdev_med_earnings=sd(median),
          min_med_earnings=min(median),
          median_med_earnings=median(median),
          max_med_earnings=max(median))
nrow(college_recent_grads)
```


Provide a discussion on what you believe the distribution of median earnings will look like.
You should discuss the center, spread, and potential shape only using these values - I do NOT want to see any data visualizations here.

**Response**: I think that the distribution will be right skewed. The median is very close to the min and thus, more observations will be to the left on the graphic than the right.


### Median Earnings by Major Category

Now we will see how the different major categories compare to the overall distribution of median earnings.
Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain similar summaries of the variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers as your `summary_earnings` code chunk, *by* for each `major_category`.
*Arrange* this summary table by the median earning.
Create a code chunk and name it `major_earnings`.

```{r major_earnings}
college_recent_grads %>%
  group_by(major_category) %>%
    arrange(median) %>%
summarise(mean_med_earnings=mean(median),
          stdev_med_earnings=sd(median),
          min_med_earnings=min(median),
          median_med_earnings=median(median),
          max_med_earnings=max(median),
          count = n())
```


Provide a discussion on how each major compares to the overall distribution.
You should discuss the center, spread, and potential shape only using these summary values - I do NOT want to see any data visualizations here.

**Response**: Agriculture and Natural Resources seem to be left skewed with a center at 35,000 and a min at 
29,000 and max at 53,000. Arts seems to be left skewed again with a center at 30,750 and a min at 27,000 and
a max at 50,000. Biology and life science has a very small spread with a min at 26,000 and a max at 45,000. 
They seem to have a center at around 36,300. The next is business. It has a regular distribution with a min at 
33,000 and a max at 62,000. The center is around 40,000. Communications and journalism has an extremely tight
distribution with a min at 33,000 and a max at 35,000. The median is 35,000. The computers and mathematics has
a normal width of distribution and does not seem to have very much of a skew as the median and means are near the
center of the distribution. Education has a tighter distribution because of its small standard deviation. It also
seems to have a normal distribution. Engineering has an extremely large standard deviation which means its shape
is wide and long. It seems to be right skew with some very large median salaries. Health has a normal
distribution. The measures of center are close and the standard deviation seems reasonable. Humanities and
Liberal arts has a tight distribution with a small standard deviation and a slight right skew as the median is
slightly closer to the lower value.


Before we continue, add the following to the end of your pipeline (you will need to pipe first) in your `major_earnings` code chunk:

```{r knit}
college_recent_grads %>%
  group_by(major_category) %>%
    arrange(median) %>%
summarise(mean_med_earnings=mean(median),
          stdev_med_earnings=sd(median),
          min_med_earnings=min(median),
          median_med_earnings=median(median),
          max_med_earnings=max(median),
          count = n()) %>%
knitr::kable()
```

Knit your document with and without this last piped code.
What changes about the output?
When would this `knitr::kable` code be useful?

**Response**: This is super useful when you are trying to create a report or something that needs to be 
professional looking in manner.

### Visualize Median Earnings by Major Category

Let us see how well your descriptions in the [Median Earnings by Major Category](#median-earnings-by-major-category) section compare to the actual distributions.
Plot the distribution of the variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers for each `major_category` using the *boxplot* and *jitter* geometries.
Create a code chunk and name it `major_boxplot`.

```{r major_boxplot}
ggplot(college_recent_grads,
       aes(x=major_category,
           y=median)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_boxplot() 
  
```


Provide a discussion on how your descriptions in the Median Earnings by Major Category section compares.

**Response**: I was spot on with the Engineering section. There is one major that is extremely high for that field. I would be interested in putting labels on the outliers.
I was spot on for many of the other categories as well with journalism not even seeming
to have a box for the boxplot because of how tight the distribution is.

<img src="README-img/noun_pause.png" alt="pause" width = "20"/> <b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you feel that you have a good understanding of these commands, feel free to start working on your project. The remainder of this activity will help to expand these commands.

### Multiple Rankings

#### Ranking by `major_category`

The current rankings provided in the data are by `major`.
Here we will develop a series of rankings to see how the `major_category` levels perform.
Create a code chunk and name it `category_rankings`.
In this code chunk, 

1. Group `college_recent_grads` by `major_category`
2. Summarize the variable `total` as the *sum* across all majors (to get the total number of majors within a `major_category`) and the following variables by their *median* value: `sharewomen`, `unemployment_rate`, and `median` earnings. Provide a meaningful name to each summarized value.
3. Assign/create a *rank* for each summarized value (rank for `total`, rank for `sharewomen`, etc.) and provide a meaningful name to each ranked column value.
4. Arrange the results so that `major_category` appear in alphabetical order ("A" at the top).

```{r category_rankings}
college_recent_grads %>%
  group_by(major_category) %>%
  arrange(major_category) %>%
summarise(sum_allmajors=sum(total),
          median_sharewomen=median(sharewomen),
          median_unemployment_rate=median(unemployment_rate),
          median_median=median(median)) %>%
summarise(rank_sumallmajors=rank(sum_allmajors),
          rank_mediansharewomen=rank(median_sharewomen),
          rank_medianunemprate=rank(median_unemployment_rate),
          rank_median=rank(median_median)) 
```


Provide a discussion on how the `major_category` rankings compare.

**Response**: The major categories that have the highest share of women also have a 
higher unemployment. The one that has the highest median rank, they one of the lower
shares of women. This is unfortunate.

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **(Final) Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.


Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a meaningful commit message), and push  to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity04-data-pieplines.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

You can now go back to the `README` file.
