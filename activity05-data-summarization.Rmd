## Data and packages

Again, we will load all of the `{tidyverse}` for this Activity.

```{r load_packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We continue our exploration of college majors and earnings from the data behind the FiveThirtyEight story [The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).
Remember that there are many considerations that go into picking a major.
Earning potential and employment prospects are two (important) of these considerations, but they do not tell the entire story.

We read in the same data from Activity 4 below, but notice that this code is now surrounded in parentheses.

```{r load_data, message=FALSE}
(college_recent_grads <- read_csv("data/recent-grads.csv"))
```

Compare this code output to the `load_data` chunk in your knitted Activity 4 `.md` report.
What does enclosing an assignment code (i.e., `object_name <- r_code`) in parentheses do?

**Response**: When I rerun the code from Activity 4, I notice that I do not get 
the table to page through. It notifies you of the 


### Data Codebook

Descriptions of the variables are again provided below.
Again note that the ACS only asks [one question](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/sex/) about a person's sexual identity.

- Do women tend to choose majors with lower or higher earnings?

## Analysis

### Median Earnings Description

### Median ... Median Earnings 

For the rest of this semester, I will no longer provide you with R code chunks.
Have no fear!
There are a number of ways to create a code chunk:

- Tired: Copy-and-paste a previous code chunk, delete the code, then add your new code
- Wired: Click on the ![new chunk icon](README-img/new-chunk-icon.png) and select ![r chunk icon](README-img/r-chunk-icon.png) (notice all the different types of code chunks that you can use within an RMarkdown file!)
- Inspired: Ctrl/Command + Alt/Option + I

Below, create a code chunk and name it `median_earnings`.
Make sure there is an empty line above and below the code chunk.



In your newly created R code chunk, verify that the median income for all majors was $36,000.
Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, verify the *median* summary statistic for the variable median earnings of full-time, year-round workers (`median`).
Name this numerical summary `median_all_majors`.

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Additional Summaries of Median Earnings

Often we would like more information than the median to help us to better understand the distribution of a variable.
Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain the sample size (i.e., *n*umber of observations), *mean*, *s*tandard *d*eviation, *min*imum, *median*, and *max*imum summaries for the variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers.
Be careful when you name your output summaries as we are dealing with things that could use the same name (i.e., "median").
When I and obtaining numerical summaries for variables, I like to include the variable name in my summary name (e.g., `mean_med_earnings = mean(median)`).
Create a code chunk and name it `summary_earnings`.



Provide a discussion on what you believe the distribution of median earnings will look like.
You should discuss the center, spread, and potential shape only using these values - I do NOT want to see any data visualizations here.

**Response**:


### Median Earnings by Major Category

Now we will see how the different major categories compare to the overall distribution of median earnings.
Using the `college_recent_grads` dataset and functions from `{dplyr}`, obtain similar summaries of the variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers as your `summary_earnings` code chunk, *by* for each `major_category`.
*Arrange* this summary table by the median earning.
Create a code chunk and name it `major_earnings`.



Provide a discussion on how each major compares to the overall distribution.
You should discuss the center, spread, and potential shape only using these summary values - I do NOT want to see any data visualizations here.

**Response**:


Before we continue, add the following to the end of your pipeline (you will need to pipe first) in your `major_earnings` code chunk:

```
knitr::kable()
```

Knit your document with and without this last piped code.
What changes about the output?
When would this `knitr::kable` code be useful?

**Response**:


![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.

### Visualize Median Earnings by Major Category

Let us see how well your descriptions in the [Median Earnings by Major Category](#median-earnings-by-major-category) section compare to the actual distributions.
Plot the distribution of the variable `median` earnings of full-time, year-round workers for each `major_category` using the *boxplot* and *jitter* geometries.
Create a code chunk and name it `major_boxplot`.



Provide a discussion on how your descriptions in the Median Earnings by Major Category section compares.

**Response**:


<img src="README-img/noun_pause.png" alt="pause" width = "20"/> <b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you feel that you have a good understanding of these commands, feel free to start working on your project. The remainder of this activity will help to expand these commands.

### Multiple Rankings

#### Ranking by `major_category`

The current rankings provided in the data are by `major`.
Here we will develop a series of rankings to see how the `major_category` levels perform.
Create a code chunk and name it `category_rankings`.
In this code chunk, 

1. Group `college_recent_grads` by `major_category`
2. Summarize the variable `total` as the *sum* across all majors (to get the total number of majors within a `major_category`) and the following variables by their *median* value: `sharewomen`, `unemployment_rate`, and `median` earnings. Provide a meaningful name to each summarized value.
3. Assign/create a *rank* for each summarized value (rank for `total`, rank for `sharewomen`, etc.) and provide a meaningful name to each ranked column value.
4. Arrange the results so that `major_category` appear in alphabetical order ("A" at the top).



Provide a discussion on how the `major_category` rankings compare.

**Response**:


![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **(Final) Planned Pause Point**: If you have any questions, contact your instructor. Otherwise feel free to continue on.


Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a meaningful commit message), and push  to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity04-data-pieplines.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

You can now go back to the `README` file.
